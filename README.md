# Third-party-risk-management-TPRM-

Synveta, an midsize R&D intensive company, has asked for a third party riskmanagement review of all of its vendors.
As a security analyst I am tasked to help among my other duties.

A lot of the TPRM process has already been done. 
There has already been a supplier discovery process performed, and a list of suppliers are now available.
Those suppliers have been properly classified in tier 1, tier 2 and tier 3. 
As other companies Synveta has much data in the cloud, utlitizing one of the big vendors from the US for this.
For this scope of this project however, those are out-of-scope.

My task is to take a closer look at one particular vendor, Zynilo Labs, that has built a SaaS application that Synveta uses.
Synveta uses this application for data analysis of scientific data, so this is definitely a tier 1 vendor.
I will send a TPRM questionnaire to Zynilo Labs, with a couple of suitable controls taken from the NIST Framework.
There could be risks associated with them, that I have take up with senior management.

The attached excel sheet containing Zynilo Lab's answers has been somewhat shortened by me, for privacy purposes.
